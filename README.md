# MoviesAPI-FrontEnd PART2

## Simple MoviesAPI
In this full stack development project, i create an application using MongoDb for the database, Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend.

I developed a movie review application that will feature a separation of concerns between the client code and the server code. 
By implementing this loosely coupled architecture, these two parts (implemented using different technologies) can evolve in parallel and independently from one another.
